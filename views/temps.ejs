    <h1>WHY CHOOSE US?</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 section-left">
        <h5>There are so many temp agencies in the market, but the reason why our clients love us is that we offer a
          niche laborer that is accustomed to installation work. <br> <br>
          Many of our workers have been trained and oriented in the
          "Culture of work" that is PMV warehouse storage solution construction/installations. Our teams know the ins
          and outs of each type of system and know how to work at a pace that this field requires.
          That's why so many other installers reach out to us for our workers to supply extra hands on their jobsites. <br><br>
          Where our competition focuses on "extra hands on the jobsite", we focus on "skilled boots on the ground".
          In other words? Quality over quantity.</h5>

        <h5> Who are our main clients in PMV TEMPS? <br><br>
          Our main clients are other installers who need to scale up their
          install crews in larger projects.<br> <br>
          Often times, our client will love a set of workers so much that they remain
          working with one client the whole year! In these cases we work directly with the client to coordinate this
          team of employees to stay consistent with said client. <br> <br>
          Instead of other temp agencies that swap out workers
          as they are available, our workers are here to work and to stay for as long as they are needed.

          "I began working with PMV Installations in 2020. As a material handling installation company, they specialize in
          conveyor, pallet rack, mezzanines, and much more. Their crew is very knowledgeable and hard working. No job is too
          large or too small and they work well with the end customer. Our customers expect the highest level of performance
          from all aspects of what we offer, including the installation of material handling systems. In our customers eyes, the
          installers we contract are a direct reflection of our company. PMV Installations have consistently met our expectations
          and in many cases exceeded them. Starting and finishing a project on time and within budget is never in question.
          Performing the work with the utmost professionalism is done every time. PMV Installations have completed several jobs
          for us without disappointment. Their high speed and exceptional attention to detail is what we have become
          accustomed to. I can assure you; you will not be disappointed with PMV Installations!"</h5>
